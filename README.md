# Introduction

This project was creating by cloning [this repo](https://github.com/shafiquejamal/reactjs-golang-example), then modifying it to use Auth0 for authentication. 

In Auth0, you should create a rule that contains a function to return the username of the user, and you should require the username on signup.
